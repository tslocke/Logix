# Logix (one from the archives)

Logix is a project I worked on back around 2004. Unfortunately it is entirely dormant right now, and personally I have no plans to resurrect it.

It is a front-end to Python that allows what I was then calling "Multi-language Programming". That is, you can easily (relatively!) create new languages, and use multiple languages freely in a single program.

It supports extensible syntax, true procedural macros and code-quoting as in Lisp, and "language inheritance" (creating new languages by extending existing ones).

It's pretty cool, if I do say so myself, and it would be great to see it picked up by someone.
